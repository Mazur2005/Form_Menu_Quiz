In this project, I focused on writing good code, not on design.
<br/>
This project has three steps:

1. First it is a form with simple REGEX validation.
2. Secondly, it's a menu with a weather API and the ability to choose a quiz.
3. Thirdly it is a quiz but with questions and answers in random order.

# Documentation

## Form

1. Has validation using [RegEx.](https://github.com/Mazur2005/Form_Menu_Quiz/blob/main/src/form/js/RegEx.js)
2. Nick name and city will be set and remember in cookie.
3. Weather API sending a question with the city selected by the user.

   - In this part, JS checks the response.
   - When bad request comes from user, commit error.
   - But when the problem comes from server or code. This API will disappear.

     <br/>

## Quiz

1. User has only one try to found a good answer. When user selected answer, background color will be changed for 0.2 seconds, for another color depends on answer:

   - Good --- blue

     <br />

2. The timer will be reset when you choose answer or skip the question, and will be stopped when all questions will be done.

   <br />

3. For the last, user will see a result quiz, points and percentage. The user will have 2 options:

   - return --- it means return to the menu.
   - repeat --- it means to repeat this quiz again.

     <br />

4. Questions and answers are random every time :).
